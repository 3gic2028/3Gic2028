I. Course Description:
The purpose of this course is to introduce the fundamentals of computer science and programming. Students will
become familiar with problem-solving techniques and algorithm development using computers, including a
structured high-level programming language. Topics will include flow of control, assignment, arrays, functions,
and input and output, among others.
II. Course Objectives:
Upon successful completion of this course, the student will have demonstrated competency in the following
course learning objectives:
1. Demonstrate basic formal problem-solving techniques for programming.
2. Describe and apply variables, basic and composite data types, and collections.
3. Develop basic and common algorithms using the elements of structured programming.
4. Use loops and conditionals in a program.
5. Create simple functions that accept parameters and return results.
6. Demonstrate effective troubleshooting, testing, and debugging of programs.
III. Program Objectives:
The outcomes of this course are aligned and developed to support the following program learning objectives.
• Advancing Computer Science
o Objective 1: Follow a software development process to analyze a problem, and to design, build, and
test software solutions.
o Objective 2: Demonstrate software development skills using more than one programming language
and development environment.
o Objective 3: Implement data-driven solutions.
• Artificial Intelligence
o Objective 5: Demonstrate software development skills using more than one programming language,
development environment, platform, and source control system.
• Data Science
o Objective 4: Create visualizations of large data sets in a way that clarify understanding of their
meaning and implications.
• Digital Maker and Fabrication
o Objective 3: Produce products that balance form and function while reflecting current and future
trends in design and human factors.
o Objective 6: Place prototype and builds within the Agile and MVP development frameworks.
• Game Programming
o Objective 4: Use software development processes to analyze a project problem and to design, build
and test a corresponding software solution.
o Objective 5: Demonstrate development skills using multiple programming languages, development
environments and platforms, including advanced and/or experimental topics in game programming.
